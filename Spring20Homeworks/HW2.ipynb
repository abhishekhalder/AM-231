Mathematically, $\\sigma :[0,\\infty)\\mapsto\\{1,2,...,m\\}$ is a piecewise constant function of time with finite number of jumps occuring at the switching instances (w.l.o.g. we take $\\sigma$ to be right-continuous). In other words, at any time $t\\in[0,\\infty)$, the value $\\sigma(t)$ simply denotes the index of the active mode among $m$ possible modal dynamics.\n",

    "Many practical situations induce switched dynamics such as occurance of different types and combinations of faults in a machine, transition between different modes in vehicle dynamics (e.g., {drive,reverse,park} for automobile, {hover,forward flight,take off,land} for helicopter), and communication packet loss in wireless control systems. A practical question then, is to guarantee that the switched system remains S/AS/GUAS **under arbitrary switching**. "
